# AP-Computer-Science-A-with-Java
These are sample programs I've used to teach AP Computer Science A.
We use http://ide.cs50.io and http://openprocessing.org to run them.
You can also use offline ides such as NetBeans and Processing.
We follow texts from http://www.horstmann.com and https://shiffman.net/
I have screencasts demoing this code on http://www.youtube.com/calcpage2009
